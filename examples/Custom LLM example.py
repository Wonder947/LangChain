# There is only one required thing that a custom LLM needs to implement:
# A _call method that takes in a string, some optional stop words, and returns a string
#
# There is a second optional thing it can implement:
# An _identifying_params property that is used to help with printing of this class. Should return a dictionary.


#Letâ€™s implement a very simple custom LLM that just returns the first N characters of the input.
