Goal:
Using LangChain build an amusing chat AI based on ChatGpt.
Particularly,
    1. properly construct a prompt template for llm, using dynamic prompt template
    2. choose ConversationSummaryBufferMemory as chatbot memory
    3. design a user iterface for interacting with the chabot
    4. (more)...

some changes:
	1. start with a LLM to decide which Langchain to use, including
		a) amusing Q&A	temperature>1, properly set prompt template, using examples
		b) serious chatbot	temperature=0, properly set prompt template
		c) wiki search bot	implemented with wiki database
		d) academic bot	implemented with citations

	after reading chap5 about agents, step1 can actually be done with agents!!!

	2. construct database for some specific LLM
	3. user can start over
	4. use sequential chains

note: advice: rewrite and considering Agents!!!
